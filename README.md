# My-Cpp-projects
This contains some of the things I have worked on to improve my C++ skills

Hangman.cpp is a simple hangman game where you guess a word out of 12 pre-selected words.

Inventory.cpp is an inventory management system that allows one to keep track of items in storage. Items can be classified according to type, price, expiry date quantity and batch lot. The interface has multiple options to add and update items, sort them according to diffent filters. The system also gives reminders to the user in case of excess inventory or if the expiry date is fast approaching.
The database is recorded in a file called "Database.txt"

Phonebook.cpp is a phonebook. Users can store numbers of individuals and can ask the interface to sort them by the names, or search for particular entries that contain a partial match of a given input like all numbers containing the substring "Jo" in the name. The database is stored in "r.txt" and must be loaded manually each time the programme is run, this allows multiple phonebooks to be stored.

Mega_program.ino is a program I wrote to control an arduino powered car through a mobile app. It allows users to change modes dynamically, choosing between Obstacle Avoidance, Line Tracking and manual Bluetooth control mode.
